removed malicious codes in files such as backdoors, web shekks, trojan, exploits, phishing, redirects, spam injection, key loggers

in database/connection.js the database key value in const connections is not specified, so i just assigned my "ias2" and the value in port shouldnt be a string in port so i just changed it to default port 3306

in server/app.js line 23, the value of secret is not specified ("your_secret_key"), so i just changed it to

.env server, i modified DATABASE_NAME, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MAILER_USERNAME, MAILER PASSWORD to establish the database connection

MY ERRORS:
COULDNT LOG IN
COULDNT CREATE AN ACCOUNT

i added a function for it to work at the end of the server controller login js
exports.PostRegister = async (req, res, next) => {

env file = client
env file = server
should be same
i added port (3306), DATABASE_NAME: "ias2", and my google secret key SECRET_KEY:, VITE_SECRET_KEY in both env file (client, server)

postRegister function updated in server/src/views/Register.jsx at the end of the file
